            and services available on those sites. If you would like to modify your browser to notify you when you receive
            a new cookie or to disable cookies altogether, please refer to Managing Cookies below. Cookies and How We Use
            Them Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your Web browser when you visit our Web sites or when
            you view advertisements we have placed on other Web sites. Cookies allow your browser to remember some specific
            information which the Web server can later retrieve and use. We do not use cookies to store any personal information
            that could be read or understood by others. When you quit your browser, some cookies are stored in your computer’s
            memory, while some expire or disappear. Cookies are used primarily for administrative purposes, to improve your
            experience with our Web sites. Examples of this would include the use of cookies: To improve site security by
            “authenticating” you (i.e., verify that you are who you say you are) when you sign-in to our site. To keep track
            of your specified preferences such as language, time zone and timeouts after periods of inactivity. To allow
            you to navigate our sites more easily by “remembering” your identity so that you do not have to input your password
            multiple times as you move between pages or services. In addition to administrative uses, we may also use cookies
            in one or more of the following ways, depending on the Web site you are using: To conduct research and analytics
            to improve our Web sites and our products and services. This includes compiling statistical information concerning,
            among other things, the frequency of your use of our Web sites, the pages visited and the length of each visit.
            To display Goldman Sachs advertisements when you visit Web sites of third parties with whom we have marketing
            relationships and to help us gauge the effectiveness of our advertising efforts. These parties may gather information
            concerning your use of other Web sites and provide us with de-identified information about you (such as demographic
            information or the names of sites where you have been shown ads) which we may use to provide you with more relevant
            and useful advertising. For more information on how we collect and use information that is identifiable to you,
            please refer to our Privacy Policy. Managing Cookies The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell
            you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive

            by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Web site of its
            manufacturer. Some of our sites employ “functionality cookies” that help the site remember your settings and
            preferences for use when you visit the site in the future. This provides a more tailored and pleasant user experience.
            These cookies store information in multiple places. On those site using functionality cookies, you will find
            a “Delete Cookies” feature on every page that will allow you to delete these cookies completely from your device.
            Please note that, if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality and, for sites using
            authentication-related cookies, declining cookies will prevent you from using the Web site altogether. To learn

## Application Purpose
"Session: study together" was created to facilitate study group creation in the coding bootcamp. Users first input their home location and study availability. which creates a pin on a public google map. Any user can then look at the availability of their classmates and create a possible study session by placing an 'event' pin on the map. The other students can join the session by clicking the 'join group' button in the 'available sessions' container. And to make sure classmates know about the session, we included a chat app so classmates can message other users, whether or not they're online. All in all, it's a complete study group application that we hope helps students group up and excel!

//soooooooo we present a form where people fill out their availability by checking each box they're available each day of the week (travel times not included)
//for what kind of time period? Generic? Go week by week? Option for each
//does each person have true/false for each time slot??

//this availability is stored on firebase with their login 


//can integrate reminders through google calendar. 

//more helpful to practice building myself or using google's features? I think build.


//make it so need to answer address to un-hide the schedule form
